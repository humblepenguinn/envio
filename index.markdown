## Welcome to envio
`envio` is a CLI tool that helps you manage your environment variables in a secure way using `profiles`. With envio, you can easily switch between different `profiles` without worrying about leaking secrets or credentials.

Visit the [installation page](/installation/) and then the [quick start guide](/quickstart/) to get started using `envio!` :)
